         <h1 id="mainHeading">Who am I?</h1>
            <h4 class="headerClass">Overview: </h4>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My name, as the webpage title and header suggest, is William (or Will. Usually Will, in fact.) I am (as of 2023) a 23 year old guy with interests in art design, sports, and 
               programming...sorta a wide net, if you ask me.<p>
            <h4 class="headerClass">Where From?</h4>
            <p>Born and raised STL! Yep, I've lives in Saint Louis, Missouri my entire life. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That said anywhere I go is gonna be broke, but I'm content 
               enough here, even if I'm not content on all fronts. You can always want more.</p>
            <h4 class="headerClass">Schooling:</h4>
            <p>Graduating from Oakville Senior High, in 2018, I moved onto Saint Louis Community College, the next year. From there, I worked hard through the weird isolated schooling of the 
               COVID-19 pandemic to a 3.49 GPA in Software Programming (with a preference in C#). I even earned my Certificate of Specialization in Web Programming, along the way. Nowadays, I 
               am a part of <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode's</a> Web Development course, in which I'm refining any prior knowledge in javascript.</p>
            <h4 class="headerClass">Skills:</h4>
            <p>Over the years, I've developed many skills, which seem to go hand in hand at many points. My knowledge of computer systems allows me to do administrative practices with little trouble.
               My skills in creating and editing digital art (as well as experience in video editing) allows me to create easy-on-the-eyes designs, while my writing capabilities makes for easy memo 
               writing and record keeping.

                  <p>This is a simple piece I drew to represent one of the more complex feelings a human can feel: stumbling into avoidable heartbreak.</p>

            <h4 class="headerClass">Hobbies:</h4>
            <p>Many of my skills go hand in hand with my hobbies. I like to draw and write in my free time, while also editing videos just for the fun of it. My more physical hobbies include inline 
               skating, various billiards games, and attending (or rarely playing) sporting events. My most engaging hobby is very much my art though. Regardless of compexity, it's the habby I put 
               the most thought and meaning into.</p>

         <h1 class="headerClass">Coding</h1>
            <h4 class="headerClass">Why do I like it? </h4>
            <p>I really enjoy making things work and seeing how they work. Since I was in elementray school, I would commonly get in slight trouble at school and at home from wanting to take things apart and 
               put them back together again. One time, even, at an engineering field trip, I accidentally shortcircuited an air pressure display because there weren't signs that said "do not touch" and I was 
               very curious to see how the air pressure fluxuated with whatever combinations of switches were pressed...it worked, so I was satisfied. Coding reminds me of that, sometimes. Regardless, my interest 
               in seeing how things work extends to computers. Being dropped into a world where computers just ARE and they just WORK has always left me perplexed. WHY do they work??? HOW do they work???<p>
            <h4 class="headerClass">Personal History: </h4>
            <p>My history with coding goes back to middle school when I grew a great interest i creating video games. As I saw that landscape widen and become oversaturated, I fell off of my interest in gaame 
               development, but my experience with it, a few years later in high school, left me interested to use it for more practical usages in the real world. From that moment, I had my mind set on what 
               I wanted to do in my life.<p>
            <h4 class="headerClass">What do you want to do with it?</h4>
            <p>I want to be of use to this world, which relies on computers. I want to help the less knowledgable people, when it comes to computers, understand how the world is working. I want to get to the point
               where I become the teacher more than the student. This field is very important and more people should treat it as such.<p>
